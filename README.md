# Awesome .NET Datascience
A curated list of awesome .Net packages, frameworks and resources for datascience.


## Interactive Development

## Dataframes
* [Deedle](https://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/) - Data frame and (time) series library for exploratory data manipulation with C# and F# support

## Visualization

## Big Data

## Data Connectivity
* [F# Data](https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) - F# type providers for accessing XML, JSON, CSV and HTML files (based on sample documents) and for accessing WorldBank data

## Language Connectivity
* [R Provider](https://bluemountaincapital.github.io/FSharpRProvider/) - Type provider that exposes R packages and functions in a type-safe way to F# callers

## Math and Statistics

## Machine Learning
* [Infer.NET](https://dotnet.github.io/infer/) - A framework for running Bayesian inference in graphical models. It can also be used for probabilistic programming.
* [Accord.NET](http://accord-framework.net/) - Machine learning framework combined with audio and image processing libraries (computer vision, computer audition, signal processing and statistics).
* [Accord.NET Extensions](https://github.com/dajuric/accord-net-extensions) - Advanced image processing and computer vision algorithms made as fluent extensions.
* [AForge.NET](http://www.aforgenet.com/) - Framework for developers and researchers in the fields of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence (image processing, neural networks, genetic algorithms, machine learning, robotics).
* [Catalyst](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/catalyst) Cross-platform Natural Language Processing (NLP) library inspired by spaCy, with pre-trained models, out-of-the box support for training word and document embeddings, and flexible entity recognition models. Part of the [SciSharp Stack](https://scisharp.github.io/SciSharp/)
* [numl](https://github.com/sethjuarez/numl) - Designed to include the most popular supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms while minimizing the friction involved with creating the predictive models.

## Deep Learning and Differential Programming
* [FsLab](https://fslab.org/) - A collection of data science and machine learning libraries for F# and .NET
* [ML.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning) - Cross-platform open-source machine learning framework which makes machine learning accessible to .NET developers.
* [Spreads](https://github.com/Spreads/Spreads/) - Series and Panels for Real-time and Exploratory Analysis of Data Streams. Spreads library is optimized for performance and memory usage. It is several times faster than other open source projects.
* [SciSharp STACK](https://scisharp.github.io/SciSharp/) - A rich machine learning ecosystem for .NET created by porting the most popular Python libraries to C#. 
* [Synapses](https://github.com/mrdimosthenis/Synapses) - An in-memory neural network library written in F#. 

## Reinforcement Learning

## Genetic Programming
* [GeneticSharp](https://github.com/giacomelli/GeneticSharp) - Multi-platform genetic algorithm library for .NET Core and .NET Framework. The library has several implementations of GA operators, like: selection, crossover, mutation, reinsertion and termination.
