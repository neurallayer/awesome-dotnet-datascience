# Awesome .NET Datascience [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
A curated list of awesome .Net packages, frameworks and resources for datascience. It is inspired by many of the other awesome pages like awesome-php.

Since almost daily new datascience related software for .Net is released or updated, this is a great place to stay up to date. 



## Interactive Development
* [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) - .NET Interactive takes the power of .NET and embeds it into your interactive experiences. Share code, explore data, write, and learn across your apps in ways you couldn't before. Right now there is support for Jupyter, nteract, and Visual Studio Code.

## Dataframes
* [Microsoft.Data.Analysis](Microsoft.Data.Analysis) - Robust and extensible types and algorithms for manipulating structured data that supports aggregations, statistical funtions, sorting, grouping, joins, merges, handling missing values and more. Currently in preview mode.
* [Deedle](https://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/) - Data frame and (time) series library for exploratory data manipulation with C# and F# support

## Visualization
* [Plot.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Plot.NET) - .NET wrapper of plotly.js for ICSharpCore.
* [XPlot](https://fslab.org/XPlot/) - XPlot is data visualization package for F# and .NET. Uses Plotly and Google Charts as "backends" to render fancy visualization.  

## Big Data
* [.NET for Apache Spark](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/data/spark) - The .NET bindings for Spark are written on the Spark interop layer, designed to provide high performance bindings to multiple languages. .NET for Apache Spark is compliant with .NET Standard—a formal specification of .NET APIs that are common across .NET implementations. This means you can use .NET for Apache Spark anywhere you write .NET code. 

## Data Connectivity
* [F# Data](https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) - F# type providers for accessing XML, JSON, CSV and HTML files (based on sample documents) and for accessing WorldBank data.

## Language Connectivity
* [R Provider](https://bluemountaincapital.github.io/FSharpRProvider/) - Type provider that exposes R packages and functions in a type-safe way to F# callers

## Math and Statistics
* [Math.NET](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/) - Math.NET Numerics aims to provide methods and algorithms for numerical computations in science, engineering and every day use. Covered topics include special functions, linear algebra, probability models, random numbers, interpolation, integration, regression, optimization problems and more.

## Machine Learning
* [Infer.NET](https://dotnet.github.io/infer/) - A framework for running Bayesian inference in graphical models. It can also be used for probabilistic programming.
* [Accord.NET](http://accord-framework.net/) - Machine learning framework combined with audio and image processing libraries (computer vision, computer audition, signal processing and statistics).
* [Accord.NET Extensions](https://github.com/dajuric/accord-net-extensions) - Advanced image processing and computer vision algorithms made as fluent extensions.
* [AForge.NET](http://www.aforgenet.com/) - Framework for developers and researchers in the fields of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence (image processing, neural networks, genetic algorithms, machine learning, robotics).
* [Catalyst](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/catalyst) Cross-platform Natural Language Processing (NLP) library inspired by spaCy, with pre-trained models, out-of-the box support for training word and document embeddings, and flexible entity recognition models. Part of the [SciSharp Stack](https://scisharp.github.io/SciSharp/)
* [numl](https://github.com/sethjuarez/numl) - Designed to include the most popular supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms while minimizing the friction involved with creating the predictive models.

## Deep Learning and Differential Programming
* [FsLab](https://fslab.org/) - A collection of data science and machine learning libraries for F# and .NET
* [ML.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning) - Cross-platform open-source machine learning framework which makes machine learning accessible to .NET developers.
* [Spreads](https://github.com/Spreads/Spreads/) - Series and Panels for Real-time and Exploratory Analysis of Data Streams. Spreads library is optimized for performance and memory usage. It is several times faster than other open source projects.
* [SciSharp STACK](https://scisharp.github.io/SciSharp/) - A rich machine learning ecosystem for .NET created by porting the most popular Python libraries to C#. 
* [Synapses](https://github.com/mrdimosthenis/Synapses) - An in-memory neural network library written in F#. 
* [Torch.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Torch.NET) - .NET bindings for PyTorch. Machine Learning with C# / F# with Multi-GPU/CPU support 
* [TorchSharp](https://github.com/xamarin/TorchSharp) - TorchSharp is a .NET library that provides access to the library that powers PyTorch. It is a work in progress, but already provides a .NET API that can be used to perform (1) various operations on ATen Tensors; (2) scoring of TorchScript models; (3) Training of simple neural networks. Current focus is to bind the entire API surfaced by libtorch.
* [MxNet.Sharp](https://mxnet.tech-quantum.com/) - MxNet.Sharp is a CSharp binding coving all the Imperative, Symbolic and Gluon API’s with an easy to use interface. The Gluon library in Apache MXNet provides a clear, concise, and simple API for deep learning. It makes it easy to prototype, build, and train deep learning models without sacrificing training speed.
